# Needfinding

The first part of our work, called *NeedFinding*, was based on two phases:

- Interview
- Questionnaire

With the latter we tried to outline the Needs (needs) and the possible Tasks of users related to the application.

### Goal
The objective of our interviews is to obtain a comprehensive and diversified view of the needs of Sapienza students in managing academic life.To get this broad and representative overview we interviewed students from various departments in Wisdom, with different levels of education, and different ages and cultural backgrounds. To this end, most of the interviews were conducted within the university itself.

## Interviews
The first step to make, as usual in needfinding, is determine questions for user interviews. The drafting of the questions is based on three macrothemes concerning 
the needs of students:

- ** Study Plan **
- ** Opinion about the Professors **
- ** Internship **

The questions in these interviews are asked in a generic way not to influence the student with our opinion, but to confirm 
that it is a necessity of every single student the opinion of about teachers so that there is awareness and clarity
in choosing a course and/or internship.

### Procedure
The procedure by which we conducted the interviews are based on the following steps drawn up by Robson and McCartan (2016):
1. An introduction in which the interviewer introduces themselves and explains why they are doing the interview, reassures interviewees regarding any ethical issues, and asks if they mind being recorded, if appropriate. This should be exactly the same for each interviewee.

2. A warm-up session where easy, non-threatening questions come first. These may include questions about demographic information, such as “What area of the country do you live in?”

3. A main session in which the questions are presented in a logical sequence, with the more probing ones at the end. In a semi-structured interview, the order of questions may vary between participants, depending on the course of the conversation, how much probing is done, and what seems more natural.

4. A cooling-off period consisting of a few easy questions (to defuse any tension that may have arisen).

5. A closing session in which the interviewer thanks the interviewee and switches off the recorder or puts their notebook away, signaling that the interview has ended.
