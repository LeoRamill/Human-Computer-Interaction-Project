# Human Computer Interaction Project: ProfessorAdvisor

Project related to the examination of *Human Computer Interaction* of the academic year 2023/2024 by the
*Intrusi di ACSAI* Team - La Sapienza University. The project is organized by the following students:

- Veronica Di Gennaro $|$ GitHub Profile: [veronicadign](https://github.com/veronicadign)
- Annafabia Gai
- Christian Gennarelli
- Daniel Y. Guarnizo Orjuela 
- Leonard Vincent Ramil

The theme of work that the team had to deal with is the following:

    <em> Help Sapienza students learn more about university career courses and internal internships, with a
    particular detail on students' opinions about professors</em>

# How did we work?

## Human-Centered Design Process
The procedure we were inspired to create the digital prototype is the Human-Centered Design Process:
1. **Needfinding**
    - What exactly is needed? How are people currently accomplishing the goal?
    - User observation, interviews, questionnaire
2. **Analysis**
    - Formalize and structure the needs
    - Create interaction scenarios, stories, tasks
    - Compare current situation with expected new situation
3. **Design**
    - Rules, guidelines, design principles
    - Modeling and describing interaction
    - Visual layout
    - Consider all inputs from cognitive models, communications theories, organization issues
4. **Iteration and prototyping**
    - Design must be supported by intermediate verification
    - Evaluate the design in its partial forms: Prototypes and Evaluation metrics
    - Involving users
5. **Implementation and deployment**
    - Hardware and software implementation
    - Documentation

## Procedure
The basic steps of creating the digital prototype are as follows:
1. [Needfinding](/Needfinding-Interviste-Questionari)
2. [Storyboarding](/StoryBoarding)
3. [Paper ProtoTyping](/PaperPrototypes)
4. [Digital ProtoTyping](/DigitalPrototypes)


# Final Results and Testing

## Testing 1: Sharing Notes

### Task
1. Search for the desired course name
2. Select the course of interest
3. Research the topic of that course you need notes on
4. View notes on that topic posted by other students (possibly sorted by other students' reviews)  

### Scenario
Imagine that you are following in the presence of the first lesson given by Giuseppe Perelli, of the teaching "Basi di Dati" and you are not clear a part of the lesson "Che cosa sono i dati?". Browse through the app to find notes on this topic, choose the ones best rated by other students regardless of the date of publication.
